# SPPU-TE-ML
About All the assignments I had performed during my college's third year in Machine Learning Lab using Jupyter Notebook as part of my academic curriculum.

You would likely notice some errors on couple of .ipynb files excluding my assignments.
<br>
It is due to my own convenience that you would understand the code on a good note about what happens if you change the case or miss a semi-colon and how the error will mess up the data flow or the environment react to your code execution in future as we all know the whole stuff's case-sensitive.

Thank You! Happy Coding Guys!
